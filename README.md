## Meetapp - Meetup Scrapper
This app was made in under 48 hours as a hackathon challenge for https://vanhack.com/.

## What it does
The app shows you what cool meetups or meetup groups are around you or around a city/address you want. It's based on categories and topics, which you can select on the feed page. 
From there you can also check details on a meetup, as well as details on meetup members and groups.

## How we built it
This app was built with Ionic 3 / Angular 4, Firebase 3, angularfire2 and the Meetup API v2.

Project can be accessed at https://meetupscrapper.web.app/ (UI is only optimized for mobile devices)

## How to run it
```sh 
  $ npm install
  $ npm run ionic:serve
```

## Important Notice
Unfortunately this app is very outdated. The meetup API v2 was shut down and the api keys in this repository do not work anymore. 
From now on all the data will be mocked just to have a running example. The repo will remain here as a good memory :)
